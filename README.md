# Activity Recognition using IMU Data

This repository contains a project for activity recognition using data collected from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and gyroscope sensors. The dataset consists of various physical activities such as "walking", "running", "still", and others, along with the sensor readings (acceleration and gyroscope) and timestamps.

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques for activity recognition from sensor data. The goal is to predict the activity based on sensor readings, which can have applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.

The repository includes:

- Data exploration and analysis scripts.
- Data preprocessing steps, including standardization.
- Model training using machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (LSTM, CNN) methods.
- Visualization of sensor data for different activities.

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
